	<!-- 
		TargetControl:
			If using an RSL (see tags above) the TargetControl tells the compiler what class name to instantiate.

				This set of properties contains the Width, Height, Top (Y), Left (X), ScaleX, and ScaleY properties.
				When an object is first added to the stage, the Width and Height properties are used as the objects
